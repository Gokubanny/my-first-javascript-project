          Experience For over 40 years, we have been making every effort to
          ensure
          <br />
          that the boldest ideas of our designers become a tangible part of
          the reality

          of our clients Despite the passage of time, one thing remains
          unchanged-the
          <br />
          values â€‹that have accompanied the Conhpol brand from the very
          beginning.
          <br />
          Reliability, commitment and passion are what at every stage of
          production
          <br />
          allows us to turn the craftsmanship of handwork into footwear art,

        <h3>Quality</h3>
        <p>The materials we use to make our footwear are an element to
        <br>
        which we attach great importance. We use high-quality Polish and
        <br>
        Italian skins (cattle, calf, goat) that meet the standards of European
        <br>
        production, and exotic skins (crocodile, ostrich, kangaroo, python)
        <br>
        with the necessary CITES certificates. They testify to the
        <br>
        authenticity and legality of the sources of their acquisition, and for
        <br>
        us they are a guarantee of the ethics of our activities. The elements
        <br>
        complementing the comfort of use are soles made of leather and raw
        <br>
        materials such as tunite, real rubber and durable, ultra-light EVA
        <br>
        Light material, which complement the comfort of use.
      </p>
         <h3>Details</h3>
        <br>
      <p>
        We eagerly follow the latest trends in the footwear industry, regularly
        <br>
        participating in international fairs, learning about the specifics of
        <br>
        other markets and training in innovative materials, accessories and
        <br>
        technologies. Thanks to the acquired knowledge and experience, we can
        <br>
        constantly develop and improve our skills, which directly translates
        <br>
        into the quality of our footwear. This is confirmed by the awards and
        <br>
        certificates obtained by Conhpol.

      <h2>Construction</h2>
      <p>
        A well-thought-out, well-designed and tested for comfort construction of the shoe is a
        guarantee of comfort of use for many years. We refine our projects until we are 100%  
        sure that the product you will receive will be the best possible solution that we can
        afford. The entire process is supervised by an experienced team of constructors and
        designers who make sure that the footwear we produce is both functional and timelessly
        fashionable .

        section that allows us to efficiently respond to technological innovations , flexibly
        adapt to modern trends and boldly set further directions of development. We are lucky
